# GDC Vault Scraper

a gdc talk title scraper by @jkap that she made for @gdc_talks

## how 2 use

1. set `CONF_ID` and `PAGES` in `index.js` to the conference id and number of
pages for that conference
  * conference id can be found in a comment on the vault
browse page

2. ```bash
npm install
node index
```

3. nice

## why did u do it like this

I wanted to finish it really quickly so that I could get the bot up and running.
I could have had it scrape conference id and number of pages automatically but
that would be a ton of work and I only had to do this once so w/e.
## are u gonna support it

hell no. if you want to change something, open a PR, I'll at least see it and
give it a cursory look. there's no tests so don't expect anything to be easy.
pls don't email me abt this.
